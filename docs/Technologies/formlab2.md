## Features

## Safety
- Resin is toxic, wear globes when handling uncured parts or the resin itself

## Tools
Part removal tool
flush cutters
scraper
Tweezers

## Setup
Reference this link to get instructions directly from the Formlabs manufacturing company. This document provides a breakdown of safety and procedural instructions according to recommendations directly from the manufacturer and employee experience related to the equipment being used and the RDF Lab. Due to the new Form 3, the Formlabs website has made it clear that the Form 2 support will continue until at least December of 2023. This means that the RDF lab can continue to use the Form 2 printers, but ensuring that the equipment is in good condition must be referenced through trusted forums and directly contacting FormLabs customer support if needed.

## Washing Instructions
 https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Using-Form-Wash?language=en_US
The Form Wash automatically cleans uncured resin from the 3D printed part. 
Ideal types of alcohol for washing prints are Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and Tripropylene glycol monomethyl (TPM). 
Wear gloves while handling resin-coated surfaces such as the tray, build platform, or print itself. If resin gets on your skin, wash skin with soap and water.
Depending on the size of the print
- If the print is large enough to be fully submerged in alcohol, remove the build platform by lifting the tab and sliding it out of the machine. Place onto handles of the form wash, keeping the print upside down.
- If the print is a size too small to maintain submerged in alcohol during the washing process, use the part removal tool to carefully remove the print from the build platform into the basket. Any excess resin on the build platform can be scraped back into its respective tank.
- Set the wash time based on the resins recommended settings (https://support.formlabs.com/s/article/Form-Wash-Time-Settings?language=en_US). Use the knob to select the appropriate time and start. Ensure that the lid closes completely after the machine automatically closes. 
The mount and basket automatically raise at the end of the wash cycle. Depending on how you washed your part(s), remove prints.
- Check pockets in the print where alcohol may have pooled or collected and drain back into the washer. If there is liquid resin still on the print, you can do an additional wash cycle. Keep this time to a minimum, because the amount of time that you wash the print in alcohol overall may affect the quality of the print. You can also dip the print into the alcohol while wearing gloves to manually wash off the excess resin. Never leave print in alcohol for longer than 20 minutes. 
- Use a dry surface with a paper towel to rest print and allow to dry for at least 30 minutes to allow the alcohol to fully evaporate from the print surface.


## Curing Instructions

## Lab Storage Procedures
- Use gloves provided in the safety cabinet to protect skin at all times.
- Use a different resin tank for each type of Formlabs resin.
- Store resin away from direct sunlight in a dry, cool, and well ventilated area. 
- Shake resin containers approximately every two weeks when in storage to keep resins thoroughly mixed.
- Clean tools with paper towels, alcohol, soap, and water
- You may leave a print in the Form Lab machine, but do not leave print inside of the wash or cure machine overnight. Accommodate time to do post-print processing during your shift in order to keep track of your own print and not interfere with others’ work. Communicate with other lab members to coordinate printing and post processing times to maintain order. 
- Close cartridge cap if (this is to maintain overall health of resin):
- Resin is not being used for a substantial amount of time (several days)


Options for post processing (after washing and curing)
You may be using resin for prototyping
